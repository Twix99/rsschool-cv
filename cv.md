Discord nickname: Timothy Mamcev  (@Twix99)
###I am a barber, but i have a great ambition to be a programmer. I think that way is good for me because i really love to get a new knowledge and make some unknown. I chose this way because here I depend on myself, my result depend on my effort.
I have a little bit knowledge anout Git, HTML and CSS

Example of coding : 

`function multiply(a, b){
reset a * b`

`function testOperation(a, b) {
var x;
x = 2 * ((a * b) % (a+b))
return x;
}`

`function testIf(a, b) {
var x;
if (a<b) {x=a+b}
else
if (a>b) {x=a-b}
else {x=a*b};
return x;
}`

Work experience: none 

Education: Course on Stepik "JS for Beginners"

English level: some time ago I had intermediate, but I had no practice for a long time.
I learned english on Advance Club.
